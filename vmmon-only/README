This files in this directory and its subdirectories are the kernel module
portion of the VMware Virtual Machine Monitor.  In order to build, make
certain the Makefile is correct, especially in whether or not your system
is multi-processor and then just type

        make

from this directory.  A copy of the module will be left in

        driver-<kernel version>/vmmon.o

(e.g. driver-up-2.0.32/vmmon.o).
