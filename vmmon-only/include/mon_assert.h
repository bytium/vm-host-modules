/*
 * Monitor Source Location
 *
 * The monitor encodes source locations -- file name & line number --
 * in just 32 bits; the process is arcane enough that it deserves a
 * little discussion.
 *
 *   o The ASSERT family of macros are expanded in the monitor to take
 *     an 'Assert_MonSrcLoc' rather than the standard '<file>,
 *     <line-number>' couplet.
 *
 *   o The '<file>, <line-number>' couplet is encoded into
 *     Assert_MonSrcLoc, which is an unsigned 32-bit integer.
 *
 *   o The upper 16-bits of Assert_MonSrcLoc are the line number.
 *
 *     Source lines above 65535 will be silently masked to 16-bits.
 *
 *   o The lower 16-bits of Assert_MonSrcLoc are the offset to the file
 *     name from the start of the file name table.
 *
 *     This, of course, implies that the size of the table containing
 *     the file names cannot exceed 64K.
 *
 *   o If we use '__FILE__' directly, gcc will coalesce all equivalent
 *     strings into a single occurrence (in '.rodata').
 *
 *     Using the full pathname for __FILE__ is undesirable because
 *     different source trees frequently have different path name
 *     lengths, and this causes the 'monitor-size' script to report
 *     differences in '.rodata'.
 *
 *   o Each __FILE__ is put into its own .assert_pathname_##__FILE
 *     section.  The monitor's runtime linker (not ld) then uses the name
 *     of this section to recover the name of the corresponding source file.
 *
 *   o At run time, prior to loading, when our linker is creating an
 *     executable image of the monitor and extensions, all the file
 *     names are extracted from these sections, the '${VMTREE}' prefix
 *     is removed, and the resulting table of shortened file names is
 *     added to a non-loadable section called '.assert_pathnames' in the
 *     VMX linker (not the bootstrap linker which does not need them).
 *
 *     Further, during linkage, each relocation to the original
 *     section containing the path name is modified so that the low
 *     16-bits contain an offset from the start of the .assert_pathnames
 *     section rather than the base of the original containing section.
 *
 *     Only three types of relocations to the assertion strings are
 *     supported (32-bit PC-relative and 32-bit/64-bit absolute) because that
 *     is all the compiler has been seen to generate.

/*
 * Assertion information is collected in a non-loadable section
 * named .assert_info.  Each record in this section contains
 * a VMM address, an assertion type, an optional bug number, and
 * the MonSrcLoc described previously.  The VMM address is a key
 * used by the VMX to look up the information associated with
 * a particular assertion failure.
 *
 * Assertion failures are fired by executing a ud2 instruction.
 *
 * For assertions which always result in a terminal user RPC, we use
 * __builtin_trap to generate the ud2, so that gcc knows that the
 * subsequent code is unreachable.  For assertions which are
 * recoverable (e.g any assertion triggered on the BackToHost path),
 * we generate the ud2 manually, so that gcc will treat the subsequent
 * code as reachable.
 *
 * The memory barriers work around a gcc bug that results from having
 * to continue past an assertion.  Without these barriers, gcc has been
 * seen to hoist code into the failing arm of the assertion, where it
 * can then tell that, because of the assertion failure, the code ends
 * up accessing an array out of bounds.
 *
 * Assertion failures for the monitor's bootstrap are reduced to panics
 * logging the current %rip.  As such, no .assert_info section is created
 * and VMX merely processes the panic.
